  [Drummond Reed, Marc Le Maitre, Bill Barnhill, Owen Davis, and Fen Labalme](http://web.archive.org/web/20070928004752/http://journal.planetwork.net/bio.php?author=Drummond+Reed%2C+Marc+Le+Maitre%2C+Bill+Barnhill%2C+Owen+Davis%2C+and+Fen+Labalme)  
New open standards introduce long-term, trusted links between people, groups, and bits over the Net.

**I. INTRODUCTION**  
    
    
**The Networking Imperative**  
    
As communications technology evolves, so do communications networks. In fact the pace of this evolution, the rate at which new network practices reach broad adoption, has been constantly accelerating, as shown in Table 1:  
    
  ![](images/swtable1.gif)  
    
**Table 1: The pace of network evolution**  
With each new network comes new capabilities—more information to share, in richer formats, over more channels, with more parties, at greater speeds. As might be expected from the pace of innovation shown in Table 1, the next evolutionary step is already upon us: the rise of social networks.  
    
    
**What is a Social Network?**  
In traditional networking terms, what are being linked are devices or objects: phones, fax machines, computers, documents. The term "social network" implies moving to the next level, where what are being linked are people and organizations. The significance of this evolutionary step is described in a seminal 2003 paper titled "The Augmented Social Network"[1] by Ken Jordan, Jan Hauser, and Steven Foster. As they put it:  
    
> "Much has been written recently about the power of social networks and the famed 'six degrees of separation.' Suppose you could go online and make relevant connections with others from whom you are separated by one, two, or three degrees? Suppose that while working on a solar energy project in California, you could use such a system to find an engineer in Shanghai whose experience is directly relevant to your project? Could the Internet be used to establish networks of trust that cross traditional borders? Can the Internet be better at supporting the ability of citizens to self-organize and participate in civil society?"
    
The rapid rise of social networking sites has already proved this a reality, even though they are "walled gardens," not interoperable as the Augmented Social Network the authors proposed calls for. By mid-2004 there were over 200 social networking sites, including Friendster, LinkedIn, Ryse, orkut, ZeroDegrees, Meetup, Tickle, and NeoSociety, and many more are coming.[2]  
    
In these communities, an initial set of founders sends out messages inviting members of their own personal networks to join the site. New members repeat the process, growing the total number of members and links in the network. Sites then offer features such as automatic address book updates, viewable profiles, the ability to form new links through "introduction services," and other forms of online social connections.  
    
**Going Open**  
    
If there is one lesson that the Internet and the Web have taught us, it is the value of interoperability, i.e., the ability to connect systems and software through open standard protocols. For example, at least a dozen early proprietary email systems were eventually superseded by the open Internet SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol). The same happened with the open World Wide Web displacing proprietary hypertext systems.  
    
Community expert David Reed explains why there is a particularly strong force compelling social networks to become interoperable:  
    
> "There is an enormous incentive to find ways to interconnect [social] networks, since the members of each network can access a much larger set of potential transaction partners."[3]
    
Reed's paper, "That Sneaky Exponential—Beyond Metcalfe's Law to the Power of Community Building," goes on to explain why social networking may in fact be the most powerful networking imperative in history:  
    
> "While many kinds of value grow proportionally to network size and some grow proportionally to the square of network size, I've discovered that some network structures create total value that can scale even faster than that. Networks that support the construction of communicating groups create value that scales exponentially with network size, i.e. much more rapidly than Metcalfe's square law."[4]
    
This phenomenon, known as Reed's Law, explains why the most valuable social network in the world would be the most inclusive. Like the development of the Internet and the Web before it, the evolution of an open, interoperable, global social network seems all but inevitable.  
    
**The Emergence of XDI**  
    
Indeed, the technical foundations for such interoperability began forming over five years ago. The development of XML in 1998 led to a digital identity project called XNS (Extensible Name Service) and the establishment of an international non-profit governance organization, XNSORG, in early 2000. By late 2002, XNSORG contributed XNS to OASIS[5] where it was divided into two layers: one for identifiers called XRIs (Extensible Resource Identifiers) and one for trusted data interchange called XDI (XRI Data Interchange).[6]  
    
The mission of the OASIS XDI Technical Committee (TC) is to follow the proven architecture model of the World Wide Web in order to enable an open XML "dataweb" as shown in Table 2:[7]  
    
  ![](images/swtable2.gif)  
    
**Table 2: Dataweb standards follow the precedent of Web standards**  
This "next-level Web" will work very much like today's Web, except it will:  
a) Link people and organizations in addition to machines and documents,  
b) Support persistent links that won't break as people and organizations change, and  
c) Address the privacy and trust issues that plague today's Web.  
    
In short, unlike the primarily public and anonymous links available over today's Web, links on the Dataweb would enable private, trusted, and bi-directional links approaching the same level of intimacy as real-world relationships.  
    
**The Social Web**  
    
This fabric of trusted online relationships can lead to the development of an entirely new layer of the Internet. This layer was foreseen by David Johnson, Susan Crawford, and John Palfrey, Jr. in their January 2004 Aspen Institute paper "The Accountable Net: Peer Production of Internet Governance."[8] In their argument for new technologies that enable Internet users to choose and verify with whom they interact, they put it this way:  
    
> "What we are positing is a state change that will amount to the addition of a new social layer to the Internet protocol stack."
    
In a technical sense, that is exactly what can happen with XDI. Just as the open standard TCP/IP protocol created the Internet, and the open standard HTTP protocol created the Web, XDI is an open standard protocol that can join today's emerging social networks into one interoperable Social Web. This layer will evolve naturally over the existing HTTP-based Web the same way the Web evolved over the then-existing Internet.  
    
  ![](images/swfig1.jpg)  
    
**Figure 1: The Social Web can evolve over the Web just like the Web evolved over the Internet**  
This paper provides a brief overview of the key building blocks of XDI, then examines the inherent structure of the Social Web and the key applications that are likely to drive its development. It concludes by looking at Social Web governance and the evolutionary stages through which it is likely to grow.  
    
**II. THE THREE KEY BUILDING BLOCKS OF XDI**  
    
The XDI Technical Committee was formed at OASIS in January 2004 by a consortium of organizations and individuals including AMD, AmSoft, Attachmate, Booz Allen Hamilton, Cordance, Epok, NeuStar, Netmino, NRI, Identity Commons, and PlaNetwork. This section introduces the three major building blocks of the XDI specifications.  
    
**1. I-Names and I-Numbers—The Universal Private Address**[9]  
    
Today's Web links web pages and other digital objects; the promise of the Social Web is to link people and organizations. While digital objects live entirely on the network and therefore have relatively stable network addresses, people and organizations live in the dynamic real world—they move and change addresses (postal, phone, fax, email, Web, IM, blog) all the time. They even change their real-world names. Yet their identity remains the same.  
    
This represents a tremendous challenge for the Social Web: how can it maintain long-term, trusted links between real people and organizations over the Internet if their network addresses are constantly changing?  
    
The answer is a new type of _abstract address_ called an XRI (Extensible Resource Identifier). Developed by the OASIS XRI Technical Committee, XRIs solve the problem of maintaining persistent addresses for people and organizations—addresses that do not need to change no matter how often the contact data for a person or organization changes. This is done by adding a new layer of addressing over the existing IP numbering and DNS naming layers used on the Internet today.  
  ![](images/swfig2.jpg)  
    
**Figure 2: XRI i-names and i-numbers are a new abstract addressing layer over IP and DNS**  
The XRI addressing layer actually consists of two layers which mirror the two layers below it— DNS domain names and Internet IP numbers. In order of increasing abstraction, these two layers are:  
    
\* _I-numbers_—machine-friendly identifiers (similar to IP addresses) that are registered to a resource (person, organization, application, file, digital object, etc.) and never reassigned. This means they can always be used to address a network representation of the resource as long it remains available somewhere on the network.[10] I-numbers are designed to be very efficient for network routers to process and resolve.  
    
\* _I-names_—human-friendly identifiers that in most cases will resolve to an i-number, making them much easier for people to use. Though typically long-lived, i-names differ from i-numbers in one critical way: they may be transferred or reassigned to another resource by their owner. For example, a company that changes its corporate name could sell its old i-name to another company, while both companies could retain their original i-number.[11]  
    
XRIs are backwards compatible with the DNS and IP addressing systems, so it is possible for domain names and IP addresses to used as i-names.[12] Like DNS names, XRIs can also be delegated, i.e., nested multiple levels deep, just like the directory names on a local computer file system. For example, a company can register a top-level (global) i-name for itself and then assign second- or lower-level (local) i-names to its divisions, employees, etc. Or a community could register a global i-name and assign local i-names to all its participating members.  
    
However XRIs also support two features not available in DNS or IP addressing:  
    
1) _Non-hierarchical peer-to-peer addressing_—a way any two network nodes can assign each other XRIs and perform cross-resolution.  
    
2) _Global context registries_—a simple, human-friendly way to indicate the global context of an i-name or i-number. There are three key types of global context registries, each represented by a single symbol as shown in Table 3.  
    
  ![](images/swtable3.gif)  
    
**Table 3: Examples of i-names and i-numbers from the three types of XRI global context registries**  
I-Names in particular are referred to as _universal private addresses_ because they solve two other longstanding problems of conventional addresses like phone numbers or email addresses:  
    
\* _Unified addressing_. Because an i-name is abstract, it is the first true "one-line business card." Given the proper permissions (see below), it can be used to automatically look up (resolve) any other contact data necessary to communicate with its owner. There is no limit to the type of data that can be resolved by an i-name.[13]  
    
  ![](images/swfig3.jpg)  
    
**Figure 3: XRI i-names and i-numbers can unify all addressing and other contact data**  
\* _Privacy control_. An i-name is literally "unspammable" because it is not an email address (or a phone number, or a fax number, or any other form of direct communications channel.) Instead the owner of an i-name controls how it is resolved, and what privacy rules must be observed before any contact can be made or data accessed. This enables new _personal contact gateways_ that can automatically filter contact requests, stopping spam before it starts. For details, see _Personal Contact Gateway_ in the _Social Web Applications_ section.  
    
In summary, XRI i-names and i-numbers are the persistent, portable, private identifiers needed to anchor the "endpoints" of the Social Web. They provide the abstraction layer and privacy barrier necessary to separate the real-world identities of the people, organizations, applications, and digital objects that will participate in Social Web relationships from the physical machines from which they currently operate.  
    
**2. Dataweb Pages—A Lingua Franca for Sharing Data**  
    
The second key building block of XDI is a solution to the complex problem of exchanging data across different domains—a problem that must be solved if people and organizations using different operating systems, different databases, and different applications are going to share the data necessary to form trusted relationships via the Social Web.  
    
The Web solved this problem by establishing one standard markup language for all Web documents—HTML. The Social Web applies the same approach using XML, the rapidly growing universal language for data representation. XDI defines an extremely simple, interoperable XML schema (technically called a _metaschema_) in which every element of data is identified with one or more XRIs.[14] XML documents in this format are called _Dataweb pages_ because they can be linked together in a manner very similar to the Web.  
    
The power of this approach is that Dataweb pages provide a single format in which any XML-encoded data (including XML documents in other schema formats) can be shared independent of the application or domain from which they originated. Additionally, using Dataweb link contracts (see below), these pages can be persistently linked and synchronized, and every page can show the precise chain-of-authority for every item of data on it, whether it is an original or a copy, and whether it belongs in the personal, organizational, or public domain of authority.  
    
**3. Link Contracts—Enabling the Dimension of Trust**  
    
Just as the World Wide Web protocols allow any two Web pages anywhere on the Internet to be linked, XDI allows any two Dataweb pages to be linked. The difference is the power of the links. Web links are essentially one-way "strings" that allow a linked document to be downloaded ("pulled") into a browser. Dataweb links are two-way "pipes" through which data can actively flow in either direction ("push" or "pull"). This flow can be controlled automatically by "valves" on either end called XDI _link contracts_.  
    
  ![](images/swfig4.jpg)  
    
**Figure 4: XDI link contracts form strong, 2-way "pipes" for trusted data sharing**  
As shown in Figure 4, XDI link contracts are Dataweb pages that control the exchange of other Dataweb pages the same way real world legal contracts control the exchange of goods, services, or intellectual property. And like real-world contracts, link contracts are flexible enough to address virtually any aspect of data control, including:  
    
\* _Authority_: Who controls the data being shared via the contract?  
\* _Authentication_: How will each party prove its identity to the other?  
\* _Authorization_: Who has what access rights and privileges to the data?  
\* _Privacy and usage control_: What uses can be made of the data and by whom?  
\* _Synchronization_: How and when will the subscriber receive updates to the data?  
\* _Termination_: What happens when the data sharing relationship is ended?  
\* _Recourse_: How will any disputes over the data sharing agreement be resolved?  
    
After i-names/i-numbers and Dataweb pages, link contracts are the third key building block required to create the Social Web. They provide a globally interoperable solution to the complex authority, privacy, synchronization, and other data control issues that exist at a higher level than the packet layer of TCP/IP or the content transport layer of HTTP.

[9] Originally known as "e-names" and "e-numbers," the "i-" prefix evolved because it better reflected their role in Internet identity infrastructure.  

[10] Depending on a registry’s policies and the registration term, an i-number can continue to resolve indefinitely after the person or organization it represents no longer exists.  

[11] This is why links on the Social Web will almost always use i-numbers. I-names will be used by people as a human-friendly alternative to an i-number.

**III. SOCIAL WEB INFRASTRUCTURE**  
    
Having covered the basic building blocks of XDI, now let's look at how they can be used to create the underlying infrastructure of the Social Web.  
    
**A Banking System for Data**  
    
Perhaps the best analog for the Social Web is the worldwide banking and credit card system. This infrastructure has evolved over centuries to facilitate the global exchange of a very sensitive form of data—money. Thus it has had to address the same issues of security, privacy, and trust as the Social Web.  
    
Figure 5 is a simple conceptual diagram of the major elements of modern banking and credit card infrastructure:  
    
  ![](images/swfig5.jpg)  
    
**Figure 5: The major elements of the global banking and credit card system**  
What Figure 5 illustrates is a globally distributed network in which every end-user (person or organization) is represented by an account at a participating service provider (bank). The banks in turn are members of different industry associations (such as the credit card associations), and are ultimately identified by their registration in various different national reserve systems.  
    
It is a classic example of many members cooperating to establish a common infrastructure that connects them all (the national reserve systems and the credit card associations), while pushing as much functionality and differentiation as close as possible to the retail service providers and their customers (the banks and their account holders.)  
    
When looked at from this perspective, there is actually a strong resemblance to the World Wide Web architecture, as shown in Figure 6.  
    
  ![](images/swfig6.jpg)  
    
**Figure 6: The major elements of World Wide Web as a distributed global network**  
In this case, the "representative" of each person and organization on the Web is their personal or organizational website. These sites are run on Web hosts (physical network servers which, unlike the banking system, may be run by the end-customers themselves.) Associations of websites and Web hosting companies, such as Truste[15] and BBB Online[16], have evolved to address various privacy, security, and trust issues. Ultimately all of these entities are identified via registrations in the global DNS (Domain Name Service) and IP (Internet Protocol) registries governed by ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).[17]  
    
Because the Social Web represents a crossing of the trust requirements of the global banking system with the technical requirements of the World Wide Web, it is no surprise that it will follow the same pattern, as shown in Figure 7.  
    
  ![](images/swfig7.jpg)  
    
**Figure 7: The major elements of Social Web infrastructure follow the same pattern**  
Each element of this infrastructure is a fascinating blend of similar functionality found in both the global banking system and the Web, as described in the sections below.  
    
**Personal and Organizational Accounts**  
    
To transact funds in the global banking system, you first need a bank account. To publish a World Wide Web site, you first need a network account (either with a third-party service provider, or on your own network server). To share data on the Social Web, you first need a _data sharing account_—a way to publish your own data and subscribe (link) to data from contacts in your social or business network.  
    
Just as there are personal and organizational bank accounts, and personal and organizational websites, there will be personal and organizational data sharing accounts. In fact the XRI specifications for i-names and i-numbers distinguishes between these by using different global context symbol characters (the "=" sign for personal XRIs and the "@" sign for organizational XRIs).  
    
So who will host these new data sharing accounts? That's the role of _i-brokers_.  
    
**I-Brokers**  
    
I-brokers are the "bankers" of the Social Web. They host the accounts people and organizations use for sharing data the same way real-world banks host accounts for exchanging funds. And just as banks offer a wide range of financial services associated with your account, i-brokers will offer a wide range of data sharing applications (see the next section, _Social Web Applications_.)  
    
Will individuals use just one i-broker for all their data? Probably not. Just as people use different banking and brokerage accounts for different financial services, they are likely to use multiple i-brokers for sharing different sets of data (personal, financial, medical, vocational, etc.) However with XDI link contracts, an account holder can choose to link all of their i-broker accounts, or just selected accounts, or none at all—just the way a website author determines which pages on the site link to the home page.  
    
What types of service providers will become i-brokers for the Social Web? Clearly those in a natural first position are the social networking sites. They already offer accounts for sharing personal data and forming links with other members.[18] The social network Neosociety has already incorporated support for i-names[19] as has the PlaNetwork collaborative wiki at Blue Oxen Associates.[20] And the developers of San Francisco-based Living Directory are creating a new XDI i-brokering service called 2idi.  
    
Once XDI software becomes widely available, many other types of service providers will be in a position offer i-brokering services, including ISPs (Internet Service Providers), ASPs (Application Service Providers), banks, insurance companies, wired and wireless phone companies, e-commerce sites, portals, etc.  
    
As with email and Web hosting, some i-brokers will specialize in services for personal account holders, some will concentrate on the business and government market, and some will be full-service brokers handling all types of accounts. In all cases, the sensitivity of the data involved will demand of i-brokers the same high standards of accountability and trust demanded today in the global banking system. The challenge is how to do this without resorting to the same type of governmental regulatory infrastructure that's taken hundreds of years to evolve.  
    
**Trust Federations**  
    
Although most Internet infrastructure has been developed through community cooper-ation and self-governance, in fact the best precedent here may actually come from the banking system. In the late 1960s, banks were struggling to get consumers and merchants to adopt credit cards. The advantages in terms of electronic funds transfer were clear. But the system was marred by the lack of a common infrastructure for credit card transaction clearing.  
    
The emergence of Visa, MasterCard, and other global credit card associations in less than a decade demonstrates how quickly such problems can be solved by cooperation. These associations addressed the twin problems of technical interoperability and business interoperability—the former through common technical specifications and the latter through common trust agreements.  
    
On the Social Web, XDI and other open standard identity and data sharing protocols can handle the problem of technical interoperability. But the challenge of business interoperability requires a new type of cooperative association similar to a credit card association. Called a _trust federation_, it is alliance of i-brokers and their customers who agree to abide by a common set of agreements in the care and handling of customer data.  
    
Identity Commons is the first trust federation implementing i-names, i-numbers, and XDI. Its initial membership is civil society organizations (non-profits, NGOs, foundations, etc.) and their service providers who wish to promote cooperation through inter-community data sharing. For more information see the Identity Commons website at [http://www.idcommons.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20071012120547/http://www.idcommons.net/) .  
    
Other XDI trust federations are expected to evolve in specific industries including telecom, financial services, and healthcare. They may also develop along geopolitical guidelines or in ways that can't be predicted from earlier social forms. XRI and XDI are flexible enough to enable trusted data sharing among any type of organizational structure, trust network, or governance model.  
    
**Global Registries**  
    
The ultimate backbone of a globally distributed network is a globally distributed addressing system. As described above, for banking this is provided by the national reserve systems, and for the Web it is provided by the DNS and IP registries overseen by ICANN. For the Social Web, it is XRI registries. These fall into two categories: 1) those set up to operate on a peer-to-peer basis using XRI cross-references, and 2) those set up to serve the general public using XRI global context symbols.  
    
The former may emerge spontaneously in any peer-to-peer data sharing context. The latter are overseen by an international non-profit called XDI.ORG.[21] The mission of XDI.ORG is to provide community-based governance for the XRI global context registry and XDI data sharing services necessary to support an open, interoperable XRI/XDI infrastructure.  
    
Just as ICANN evolved out of the need for community-based global DNS and IP governance, XDI.ORG evolved out of the need for community-based global XRI governance. However ICANN had significant early challenges in developing a representative model because it was retrofitted onto already-operating infrastructure. In this respect XDI.ORG enjoys three advantages:  
    
\* The ability to start fresh with a new layer of infrastructure.  
\* The authority to govern this infrastructure by virtue of holding the intellectual property rights covering the underlying technology as a public trust.[22]  
\* The mandate (specified in its intellectual property rights license) to be governed according to a fully open, transparent, representative community process.[23]  
    
XDI.ORG acquired the intellectual property rights to the underlying dataweb technology from Cordance Corporation in July 2000 and subsequently contributed these rights to OASIS to form the basis for the XRI and XDI specifications. With the emergence of these specifications during 2004, the next task is for XDI.ORG to oversee setting the technical and operational standards for XRI global context registry services and global service providers. Cordance is the first such provider,[24] and will begin offering a test program of global i-name and i-number registry services in conjunction with Identity Commons in August 2004.[25]  
    
As the emergence of XDI infrastructure begins to attract different constituencies with a stake in its governance, XDI.ORG will work with these constituencies to develop a long-term membership and governance model.

One other major element of Social Web infrastructure has no direct precedent in global banking or Web infrastructure. The reason is that these systems are based on the exchange of a well-defined set of data—currency in the first case and HTML pages in the latter.  
    
The purpose of XDI, however, is to enable the automated interchange of _any_ type of data, much the way human languages enable the discussion of any type of subject. To do so across many different XDI communities requires the same vocabulary-sharing tool used by human languages: _dictionaries_. A Dataweb dictionary is simply a collection of Dataweb pages used to define and describe the XDI data that can be shared by subscribers to that dictionary.  
    
Yet because they are entirely written in XML, Dataweb dictionaries can be much more powerful than their paper equivalents. They can be crawled by new "dictionary spiders" to automatically build maps between concepts and taxonomies used across multiple communities. In this way Dataweb dictionaries can also grow and evolve much faster than conventional dictionaries. Like today's Web search engines, they will be constantly monitoring the population of Dataweb pages to which they have access, creating a dynamic map of the evolving vocabulary of the Social Web.  
    
**IV. SOCIAL WEB APPLICATIONS**  
    
Just as the emergence of credit cards led to a plethora of new telephone and mail order shopping businesses, and the emergence of the Web led to the development of shopping carts, auction sites, advertising networks, content delivery networks, wikiwebs, etc., the emergence of the Social Web will bring new applications that are only possible with a trusted data sharing protocol. The following is an overview of some of these applications.  
    
**Personal Contact Gateways**  
    
Phone numbers and email addresses, for all their convenience, make it all too easy for those who want to steal our time and attention. The first and likely most common Social Web application will be the personal contact gateway: a simple way to give every i-name owner privacy control over the use of their address.  
    
  ![](images/swfig8.jpg)  
    
**Figure 8: I-names provide a personal contact gateway, stopping spam at its very source**  
The gateway (typically a Web form) is hosted by your i-broker. When a request from an unrecognized contact is received, the gateway page can apply the same type of filtering and qualification tests performed by social networking sites today, such as:  
    
\* Validate that the request is from a real human being (a test used by many websites today to stop spam robots).  
\* Verify the requestor's email address (by sending an email to which they must reply).  
\* Confirm the requestor is a member of a trust federation.  
\* Confirm whether the requestor was referred by a friend or colleague.  
    
Although contact gateways will not put an immediate stop to spam, they will put a stop to the harvesting of email addresses by spammers, as it will no longer be necessary to post an email address directly online. When paired with trust filters (below), they spell the beginning of the end of the era of spam.  
    
**Trust Filters**  
    
Imagine if your bank account received as many spurious requests for funds transfers as your email inbox receives spurious marketing requests today. The entire banking system would collapse. Many are warning that Internet email infrastructure is in similar danger as spam mounts to nearly half of all Internet email traffic.[26]  
    
It has been widely acknowledged that the solution is a simple, standard form of email sender authentication, such as proposed by Yahoo's Domain Keys[27], Microsoft's Caller ID for Email[28], or the open source Sender Policy Framework[29]. However the challenge of sender authentication has never been primarily technical—it has always been the chicken-and-egg problem of adoption. Sender authentication-based _trust filters_ are not effective until they are in widespread use, yet spam prevention alone has not been enough to spur adoption.  
    
The emergence of Social Web infrastructure can finally solve this problem. The numerous benefits of i-names/i-numbers and XDI can turn automated identity authentication into as standard a feature of Internet infrastructure as DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)[30]. Furthermore, the development of global trust federations can provide the real-world accountability necessary to make it as difficult to spoof an authenticated email sender as it is to spoof a banking transaction.  
    
**Intelligent Email Management**  
    
Besides eliminating unwanted email, the Social Web can also make it much easier to manage the email you do want. XDI headers and link contracts provide a powerful new way to filter and respond to incoming messages. Instead of filtering based on standard email headers or content analysis, intelligent XDI filters can process XDI headers using the associated XDI link contract(s) to perform much more intelligent message pre-processing, including:  
    
\* Organizing all messages and attachments by thread (subject line) with 100% accuracy.  
\* Sorting messages and performing context-sensitive user notification based on preferences and priorities assigned to the associated link contract.  
\* Automatically forwarding or distributing messages among XDI auto-groups (see below).  
\* Archiving messages based on preferences of the associated XDI link contract.  
    
**Auto-Address Books and Auto-Calendars**  
    
Personal contact and calendar managers like MS Outlook are now standard business productivity applications. Some are used standalone by individuals. Others are linked into groupware systems such as Lotus Domino, MS Exchange, or Yahoo Business Services, where data sharing operations can be automated between account holders in the same system.[31]  
    
Yet until XDI there has been no way to share groupware data _across_ systems. With an XDI interface, any groupware system (client-side or server-side) can automatically exchange contact or calendaring data with any other XDI system the same way any web browser can talk to any web server. Establishing new contacts or scheduling meetings between users or groups anywhere on the Web can become as simple as sending an XDI message.  
    
This capability is especially powerful when it comes to global address changes. For example, when an individual moves, changes jobs, or changes ISPs, just one change to their contact data at their personal i-broker can generate a global XDI change-of-address message across all applicable link contracts (family, friends, business contacts, utilities, stores, websites, etc.)  
    
Likewise the business card exchange of the future may be no more than entering a single i-name into your local address book (or beaming it across Bluetooth), and then letting your i-broker establish bi-directional link contracts for the desired XDI business card(s) you wish to share. You and your contact can now keep those cards automatically synchronized for as long as you both want to keep the relationship—no matter how often you move or change jobs.  
    
**Auto-Registration, Auto-Login, & Auto-Personalization**  
    
Another frequent Web user experience is manually registering, signing on, or personalizing an account at a website. This task exists today because there is no standard for automated, privacy-protected personal data interchange. XDI-enabled websites will make this type of manual data entry as obsolete as manual typewriters. On the Social Web, users will be able to:  
    
\* _Register at a new website_ by clicking once on an XDI auto-registration button (and optionally approving the registration data requested by the site). Privacy negotiation can be handled automatically by the user's i-broker (see below).  
\* _Zero-click automatic login at any previously-registered website_ unless your user preference is to remain anonymous (in which case you can manually login with one-click on a XDI auto-login button when you need to.)  
\* _Automatically personalize any site_ that supports XDI (unless your user preference is not to share personalization data.)  
    
Furthermore, with i-brokers, none of these features will be constrained to working with only a single device (desktop, laptop, PDA, cell phone, etc.). All of a user's XDI-enabled devices will be able to synchronize new links and link contracts via the user's personal or business i-broker(s). Users can even completely customize a new device within minutes just by logging it into their i-broker and selecting their XDI configuration preferences.  
    
Websites, for their part, will enjoy both high trust relationships and high-quality, always-fresh customer data without the need to worry about constant data "cleansing."  
    
**Auto-Privacy Negotiation & Digital Identity Theft Protection**  
    
One of the largest concerns regarding sharing personal data over the Internet today is privacy. How can a user be assured that, once shared, his or her personal data will only be used according to the user's preferences?  
    
Much progress has been made with the development of machine-readable privacy policies and privacy preference agents based on the World Wide Web Consortium's Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) protocol.[32] XDI takes privacy management to the next level: any time a user needs to register or share data with a website, the site can automatically negotiate privacy preferences with the user's i-broker.  
    
This is a win for both users and sites. Users can have a simple, standard way to track and update data sharing permissions, and sites have a standard way of recording and monitoring user privacy preferences. Furthermore, both gain the benefit of automated XDI synchronization to keep sites updated with any changes to the user's contact, preference, and other personal information.  
    
The Social Web can also provide powerful new solutions for digital identity theft protection. For example, by using reverse-authentication whenever changes are requested to a user's XDI account[33], i-brokers can make it much easier to ensure that only authorized account holders have access to the account.  
    
**Auto-Forms & One-Click Transactions**  
    
Besides basic account and relationship management, XDI can support the exchange of any data necessary to automate a transaction, from a simple e-commerce purchase to an entire online mortgage application. All it requires is for the merchant to create an XDI link contract describing the requested XDI data along the security, privacy, synchronization, and other terms governing its use.  
    
This means "one-click" automated purchasing can now be available at any XDI-enable site, even one that does not use the user's native language (provided a Dataweb dictionary can do the necessary mapping between XDI data elements.)  
    
**Auto-Lists and Auto-Groups**  
    
Many of the capabilities discussed above will simplify and improve a user's current online experience. But the most exciting applications of the Social Web will be those that are simply not possible without it, just like online shopping carts, auction sites, and search engines were not possible without the Web.  
    
One of these is "auto-groups," or real-time automated group formation. As Reed's Law posits, group formation is of particularly high value to communities of all kinds. The faster new groups can be formed to reflect new initiatives, new teams, new projects, or new partners—and the more efficiently they can be managed—the greater the benefits to everyone involved.  
    
The closest thing to auto-group formation on the Internet today is the act of sending an email message to multiple recipients. However anything more than this, such as creating an email list server or setting up a wikiweb site, requires tedious interaction with an external server (or an even longer wait for an email or web administrator.)  
    
And that's just the first step in group coordination. To go beyond discussion to action requires adding other collaboration tools like calendaring systems, file sharing systems, instant messaging systems, etc. Each of these has its attendant setup time and cost, increasing the effective overall friction of new group formation.  
    
XDI can overcome the tedious steps involved with creating and provisioning new groups no matter how many companies, organizations, or communities are involved. All it required is an i-name and/or i-number for the group and an XDI link contract defining membership. Depending on the capabilities of the host i-broker(s), all the XDI automated data sharing features and functions described in this section can be available to the group immediately. And every group member can use their own i-broker account to simplify and manage all their group memberships and preferences.  
    
Furthermore, auto-groups can scale to any size project. New groups can be formed alongside or nested within existing groups, and groups can be linked across multiple XDI communities. XDI group management can be delegated as necessary using link contracts, so it can support any model of centralized or decentralized decision making.  
    
**Social Search**  
    
Another breakthrough XDI application will be "social search"—searches that require sensitive permission, relationship, reputation, and other trust metadata not available to today's search engines. Dating and job hunting are the two most common examples today, so it's no surprise these are the first applications offered by many social networking sites. However they represent only the tip of the social search iceberg. Other examples of social search include:  
    
\* Searching for a particular skill set across a network of volunteers who make their skills experience available to NGOs and non-profits for particular projects.  
\* Searching for grants or funding for a project that has already obtained endorsements from experts in a certain field.  
\* Searching for people who have long-term experience with a particular make, model, or brand of product and are not affiliated with the manufacturer or resellers.  
\* Searching for merchants in a particular neighborhood that are recommended directly by community residents.  
\* Searching for a particular antique across vendors that offer a strong guarantee of authenticity.  
    
Many more examples of the power of social search are discussed in "The Augmented Social Network" and the work of other social networking pioneers including Vladis Krebs, developer of InFlow social network analysis software.[34]  
    
**Reputation Networks**  
    
Imagine a Google where the page rankings reflect trusted community feedback about the quality of the information and the links. The service would be invaluable. Such is the power of XDI reputation networks, where such rating and evaluation information is gathered via authenticated XDI link contracts that ensure its security and integrity.  
    
Although a full exploration of this topic beyond the scope of this paper, work such as OpenPrivacy's Reputation Capital Exchange (which enables users to carry some or all of one's accumulated reputation or social capital from one site to another)[35] and eBay's Feedback Forum[36] show that reputation networks can help people and organizations select products, services, vendors, suppliers, and partners faster and more intelligently. They can also become powerful new forces shaping the evolution of both civic and commercial organizations and markets.

**V. SOCIAL WEB GOVERNANCE**  
    
Like any new social structure, the emergence of the Social Web invites fascinating questions about how it will be governed. This issue is explored in great detail in the previously-cited Aspen Institute paper "The Accountable Net: Peer Production of Internet Governance." The authors summarize their thesis as follows:  
    
> "We think the internet will become more orderly over time, but we do not agree that the internet needs, or will easily yield to, more centralized authority—private or public. To the contrary, we believe a new kind of online social order will emerge as the result of new technologies that now enable a more powerful form of decentralized decision-making. These technologies will give private actors greater control over their digital connections. They will enable both end users and access providers to accept messages and establish connections based on trust of the originating party. These choices about messages and connections are themselves a form of governance. Because of these new developments, participants on the internet will be more accountable to one another than they have been in the past."[37]
    
This peer-based model of Internet governance fits perfectly with XDI and the Social Web, as we will explore briefly in this section.  
    
**Implementing Peer Governance Using XDI Link Contracts**  
    
The essence of governance is common agreement over decision-making authority. The thesis of "The Accountable Net" is that there is no one governance model for the Social Web because every peer is its own authority. Therefore governance should arise naturally from the decisions each peer authority makes over whom it will connect with and what information it will share.  
    
As shown in Figure 9, this can be modeled directly with XDI accounts and link contracts. Each "citizen" is an account holder and each "governed relation" is a link contract. This model is as democratic and decentralized as linking on the Web. Any XDI account holder can negotiate a link contract with any other XDI account holder just as any Web page can link to any other Web page.  
    
  ![](images/swfig9.jpg)  
    
**Figure 9: Peer-to-peer governance can be implemented by XDI link contracts**  
What this model gains in equality, however, it lacks in efficiency. Few of us want to take the time to negotiate every relationship "from the ground up." It is far more efficient to establish a common set of contracts which we can apply as needed (and individually customize when necessary).  
    
These common contracts represent _groups_—any kind of group from a book club to company division to civic organization to a nation-state.  
    
  ![](images/swfig10.jpg)  
    
**Figure 10: Group governance as represented by link contracts**  
As shown in Figure 10, every member of an XDI group shares a copy of the group contract (or contracts—there may be more than one). The only difference with a peer contract is that the group contract is shared by all members of the group and governs what information will "flow" in and out of the group rather than just between two peers.  
    
Of course, as shown in Figure 11, groups can also be members of other groups. This fractal pattern can be continued to any degree of complexity, enabling the Social Web to accommodate many types and permutations of organizational or governmental structures.  
    
![](images/swfig11.jpg)  
So of all the possibilities, what are the natural patterns of group governance needed to ensure trust in the Social Web infrastructure itself?  
    
**The Role of Trust Federations**  
    
Every i-broker offers a basic level of group governance to its customers through the service agreement it has with each of them. But that doesn't mean its customers have trust relationships with each other. Nor does it mean any two i-brokers have a trust relationship. How can group governance help the formation of these trust relationships?  
    
As discussed above, the banking industry solved this problem for credit card clearing by creating trust federations like Visa and Mastercard. In XDI terms, the role of a trust federation is even more explicit: to establish and govern the group link contracts that form the common trust agreements binding all members of the federation.  
    
These link contracts can be particularly efficient if they use the fractal group model, i.e., if i-brokers become first-degree members of the federation, and account holders second-degree members through their i-broker. Identity Commons is currently implementing this model, and other XDI trust federations are expected to follow suit.[38]  
    
So how do trust federations establish common trust agreements amongst themselves? While it would be feasible to do this on a peer-to-peer basis, the fractal XDI model suggests another solution: a "supergroup" contract between the trust federations that represents the very "foundation of trust." From an historical perspective, this link contract would be the digital representation of Jean Jacques Rousseau's famous "social contract" that binds us all as civilized human beings.[39]  
    
The natural home for such a contract is XDI.ORG, and indeed this responsibility was added to the XDI.ORG charter in June 2004.[40] XDI.ORG plans to begin holding public discussion groups and forums on this topic starting in September 2004 and to publish the first version of this "digital social contract" by early 2005.  
    
**VI. SOCIAL WEB EVOLUTION**  
    
If the emergence of the Social Web is as inevitable as the emergence of the Internet or the Web, it begs the question of how this evolutionary process will unfold. Although nothing in global networking is completely predictable, the evolutionary stages of the Internet and the Web—as well as that of credit card infrastructure in the 1960s—provide a guide to the likely stages of Social Web development.  
    
**Seed Stage (2004)**  
    
The first stage is always the cooperative development of common open standards for the necessary infrastructure. This is the stage the Social Web will be completing in 2004 with: a) publication of the XRI 1.0 specifications from the OASIS XRI Technical Committee, b) publication of the upcoming XDI 1.0 specifications by the OASIS XDI Technical Committee, c) the establishment of the first XDI-based trust federations such as Identity Commons, and d) the commencement of the first XRI global context registry services from XDI.ORG.  
    
**Island Stage (2005)**  
    
Once these first open standards and public services are available, the first islands of XDI usage can start to surface like landmasses surfacing out of an ocean. Likely candidates include:  
    
\* The first i-brokers that have a reason to register their existing customers.  
\* The first user communities that have strong, immediate data sharing needs.  
\* The first trust federations that solve broad horizontal trusted data sharing problems such as single sign-on or spam control.  
    
During this stage, the infrastructure and the applications that require this infrastructure must evolve in lockstep. For example, just as the first ISPs were needed before users could start using Internet email or Web browsers, the first i-brokers are needed before users can start using personal contact gateways and trust filters. As demand for more Social Web applications grows, more i-brokers and trust federations will appear, and the spiral will continue.  
    
**Continent Stage (2006-7)**  
    
As the islands multiply, they will begin to interconnect and form continents. The more XDI link contracts can enable fine grained data sharing between communities, the faster trusted data begins to flow, and the more benefits are realized. At this stage entirely new types of communities are possible, and the first Social Web-only applications will appear (similar to the shopping carts, auction sites, and search engines that were only possible with the Web).  
    
**Global Stage (2008+)**  
    
Lastly, as with the convergence of standalone networks to the Internet, or proprietary email systems to Internet email, the continents will begin to join into one unified global Social Web. At this point the benefits of persistent identity and trusted data sharing will start to become universally available, much as credit cards, the Internet, or the Web are today.  
    
**VII. CONCLUSION**  
    
The constant progress of the "networking imperative" combined with the value of trusted relationships has made the emergence of an open social network a virtual certainty. The XDI trusted data interchange specifications under development by the OASIS XDI Technical Committee fit this need. By marrying the proven architectural model of the World Wide Web with persistent, private, portable identifiers developed by the OASIS XRI Technical Committee, XDI enables a new layer of Internet infrastructure that resembles a "banking system for data."  
    
I-brokers—the bankers of the Social Web—will enable individuals and organizations to enjoy a wide variety of new applications that do for electronic data sharing what credit cards did for electronic funds transfer. New trust federations will further guard the privacy and security of shared data by establishing common policies and agreements similar to those used by credit card associations today.  
    
The resulting platform will generate as wide a variety of new applications as the Web did before it. Ranging from auto-login to social search, these applications will change our experience of the Internet from one of a vast untamed frontier to one of a rich and vibrant social neighborhood. In this neighborhood new relationships can be formed and sensitive data shared, linked, and persistently synchronized with the same confidence and trust with which money can be exchanged in the global banking infrastructure today.
